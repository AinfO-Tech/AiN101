## Q&A

Q: Will the follow-up lectures be in pure English?

A: PowerPoint and material will be in pure English. But Moz’s speaking level is average, so …… Mandarin in lectures.

Q: Is there a fee for AiN101?

A: Yes, there will be a fee. But each of you only need to pay 1 RMB to Moz.If you want to pay more, Moz will happily open his jacket pocket.

Q: Can I quit AiN101 halfway through?

A: Try to let go of such thoughts. Unless you can provide proof of force majeure. e.g. World War III broke out.

Q: Will there be a final test for AiN101? For what？

A: Yes, if AinfO Technology is listed on NASDAQ, this score will be related to the percentage of shares you get (doge).

Q: Should I ask questions?

A: If you don't ask questions, Moz will give you a low score and scold you until you feel ashamed
